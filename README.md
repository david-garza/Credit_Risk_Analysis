# Credit Risk Analysis

# Overview of the analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to create a machine learning model that can accurately identify loan applicants as high or low risk.

The challenge unique to this dataset is the occurance of high risk loan applicants is very low. This makes it difficult for any model to accurately predict and identify high risk applicants. 

To overcome this issue, 4 different sampling methods and 2 ensemble are applied to the modeling.

Throughout the analysis the following values are used to identify a loan applicants status:

0 = high risk,
1 = low risk

# Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

# Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
